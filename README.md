## Purpose of This Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to create my personal website, where I can present myself to others‚Äîwhether a future employer or a potential client.

Another important reason for this project is that I didn‚Äôt have any side projects before, but I wanted to start working on something in my free time to acquire new skills and showcase them to the world. This project is my first step in demonstrating what I know. It‚Äôs a simple and raw HTML and CSS setup for now, but it‚Äôs just the beginning!

So, in short, in 2025, I decided to start my own journey, learning the skills I enjoy and want to use‚Äîwhile having fun along the way! ‚ù§Ô∏è
